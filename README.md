## What It Does

LUNA analyzes your code and generates **three types of documentation**:

### 1. Encyclopedia Summaries (For AI Agents)
Structured summaries (Markdown + JSON) that Copilot agents can query instantly without burning tokens.

```
1. Generate summaries once → Structured MD + JSON in .codebase/
2. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+I)
3. Ask: "What does extension.ts do?"
4. Copilot queries summaries (instant, zero tokens!)
```

### 2. API Reference (For Development Speed - NEW!)
Automatic extraction of ALL API endpoints with complete request/response schemas.

```
After generation:
Ask Copilot: "What's the endpoint for updating characters?"
→ Instantly get: path, method, request schema, response schema, auth requirements
No more grep → read → guess → grep again!
```

### 3. Code Breakdowns (For Learning)
Line-by-line educational explanations that teach you how your code works.

```
Right-click any file → "LUNA: Explain This Code"
→ Generates detailed breakdown with explanations, examples, and gotchas
→ Adjustable verbosity (Beginner/Intermediate/Expert)
```

**What you get:**
- Human-readable markdown summaries with line numbers
- Machine-readable JSON for AI agent queries  
- **Complete API reference (endpoints, schemas, auth)** (NEW!)
- Educational code breakdowns
- Bidirectional dependency graphs ("uses X" + "used by Y")
- Code complexity analysis + refactoring guidance
- Dead code detection with AST-based analysis
- Smart architecture component mapping
- Quality assurance reviews
- **Multi-language support (Python, TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, JavaScript)** (NEW!)
- **Reset command** to start fresh (NEW!)
- **Async worker agents for parallel task delegation** (NEW in v1.1.15!)

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize
```
Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) → "LUNA: Initialize Workspace"
```

### 2. Generate Summaries
```
"LUNA: Generate Codebase Summaries"
(takes 2-10 minutes depending on project size)
```

### 3. Query with Copilot
```
Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+I) → Switch to Agent Mode
Ask: "What's the architecture?" or "Which files are most complex?"
Copilot instantly answers from your summaries
```

### 4. Query API Endpoints (NEW!)
```
Ask Copilot: "Show me all POST endpoints"
→ #get_api_reference filter_method="POST"

Ask: "What's the endpoint for updating characters?"
→ #search_endpoints query="update" search_in="description"
→ Instant: path, method, request schema, response schema, auth
```

### 5. Learn Your Code
```
Right-click any file → "LUNA: Explain This Code"
Choose verbosity: Beginner (full detail) / Intermediate / Expert
Get a complete educational breakdown saved as filename.breakdown.md
```

### 6. Keep Summaries Fresh
```
After committing code changes:
Command Palette → "LUNA: Update Stale Summaries"
(Only regenerates modified files - much faster!)
```

### 7. Reset If Needed (NEW!)
```
Command Palette → "LUNA: Reset .codebase Directory"
→ Safely delete all summaries and start fresh
```

**Pro Tip**: LUNA automatically watches for git commits from ANY source (terminal, GitHub extension, VS Code UI, etc.) and prompts you to update summaries. No manual setup needed!

## Async Worker Agent System (v1.1.21) - FULLY AUTONOMOUS & PRODUCTION-READY!

LUNA now features **fully autonomous worker agents** with complete tool access and proven reliability in production.

**How it works:**
- Main AI agent (like Luna in Copilot Chat) spawns background workers
- **Workers have FULL tool access** - they can read files, write files, search code, and use ANY VS Code tool
- Workers run multi-turn conversations (up to 20 turns) to complete complex tasks autonomously
- Workers see results of their actions and can adapt, retry, or fix issues
- **File creation works flawlessly** via intelligent JSON output parsing
- All while using **FREE models** (gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, raptor-mini)!

**What Workers Can Do (Autonomously!):**
- **Read files** - Workers can examine any code they need
- **Write files** - Intelligent JSON parsing with automatic escape sequence handling
- **Search codebase** - Find patterns, dependencies, usage examples
- **Multi-step workflows** - Read → Analyze → Create → Verify → Document
- **Error recovery** - Workers see tool results and can retry/fix issues
- **Query LUNA summaries** - Workers can use all LUNA tools for context
- **Parallel task delegation** - Spawn multiple workers for massive speedup

**Key Benefits:**
- **True autonomy** - Workers complete complex tasks without supervision
- **Zero cost** - FREE models (gpt-4o) with full agent capabilities
- **Production-proven** - Tested and working with complex workflows
- **Multi-turn reasoning** - Workers can make 20+ sequential decisions
- **Smart file creation** - JSON blocks with automatic newline/escape handling
- **Automatic** - No setup needed, works out of the box

**How File Creation Works (The Secret Sauce):**
Worker returns this in their response:
```json
{
  "action": "create_file",
  "path": "docs/output.md",
  "content": "# Title\n\nContent here with \\n for newlines"
}
```

LUNA automatically:
1. Detects the JSON block (```json...```)
2. Parses the content field
3. Unescapes `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\` sequences
4. Creates file at the specified path
5. Logs completion with full path

**Result:** File created perfectly formatted

**Example: Autonomous Architecture Documentation**
```javascript
// In Copilot Chat (Agent Mode):
const task = await spawn_worker_agent({
    task_type: 'documentation',
    prompt: `Create architecture summary:
    1. Call mcp_lunaencyclope_get_component_map
    2. Format as markdown
    3. Return JSON block for file creation`,
    model: 'gpt-4o', // FREE!
    auto_execute: true
});

// Worker autonomously:
// - Calls get_component_map (tool call)
// - Formats data into markdown
// - Returns JSON block with markdown content
// - Extension parses and creates docs/ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md
// 
// Total cost: $0 | Total time: 10-30 seconds | Result: Professional documentation
```

```

## Agent Instructions (Recommended)

To maximize accuracy, teach Copilot to prioritize LUNA summaries. Add this to your system prompt or create a custom agent:

```markdown
# LUNA-First Protocol

When answering questions about code:

1. **ALWAYS check LUNA summaries first** before reading source files
   - Use #search_summaries to find relevant files
   - Use #get_file_summary for detailed analysis
   - Use #get_dependency_graph for relationships
   - **Use #get_api_reference for API questions** ← NEW!
   - **Use #search_endpoints to find specific endpoints** ← NEW!

2. **Only read source code** for:
   - Critical security/business logic verification
   - Implementation details not in summary
   - Debugging specific issues

3. **Self-Maintenance**:
   - If you perform a significant refactor or notice a summary is stale, **suggest that the user run the "LUNA: Summarize File" command** to update the encyclopedia.
   - This keeps the user in the loop and ensures the encyclopedia remains a source of truth.

4. **Benefits**:
   - Instant answers (summaries are cached)
   - Zero token waste (no re-reading files)
   - Focus on higher-level architecture
   - Always up-to-date (summaries track git history)
   - **Complete API documentation at your fingertips** (NEW!)

This protocol maximizes efficiency and accuracy.
```

**How to use**:
- Create a file: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and paste the protocol there (VS Code workspace standard!)
- Or create a custom Copilot agent with these instructions
- Or add to your personal system prompt
- Share with your team for consistent behavior

**Pro tip**: After setup, ask Copilot "Are my summaries up to date?" to see LUNA in action!

### AI Code Review (NEW - v1.1.25)
Review file changes for bugs, logic errors, performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and unintended side effects. Uses the same FREE model from your LUNA settings (gpt-4o by default) -- zero premium requests consumed.

**Two ways to use it:**

**1. User Command (Right-click or Command Palette):**
```
Right-click any file → "LUNA: Review Changes in This File"
- or -
Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) → "LUNA: Review Changes in This File"
```
- Prompts you to select a review focus (All, Bugs, Performance, Security, Style)
- Uses the model from Settings > LUNA > Copilot Model (default: gpt-4o, FREE)
- Shows progress notification with cancel support
- Opens review results in an untitled markdown tab (close it when done, nothing saved to disk)
- No files created, no clutter, no premium requests

**2. MCP Tool (For AI Agents):**
```
"Review the changes I just made to extension.ts"
→ #review_file_changes file_path="src/extension.ts"

"Check this file for security issues only"
→ #review_file_changes file_path="src/auth.ts" review_focus="security"
```
- Agents can pass `old_content` / `new_content` directly for inline diff comparison
- Returns a task ID for async polling via `#check_worker_status` or `#wait_for_workers`

**What happens when you trigger it:**
1. Selects the model from your LUNA settings (same one used for summaries)
2. Reads the current file and computes git diff (unstaged, staged, or HEAD~1)
3. Loads existing LUNA summary for context (purpose, dependencies)
4. Sends everything to the model via the Language Model API
5. Streams the response into an untitled markdown document

**Review Focus Areas:**
- `all` - Comprehensive (default): bugs, performance, security, style, side effects
- `bugs` - Logic errors, null handling, off-by-one, runtime crashes
- `performance` - Inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, unnecessary operations
- `security` - Input validation, injection, authentication gaps
- `style` - Readability, naming, DRY violations, maintainability

**Why this matters for AI-assisted development:**
When AI writes your code, you get a second AI reviewing it -- using a fast, free model that won't eat your premium request quota. The review has full context: the diff, the file, and LUNA's summary of the file's purpose and dependencies.

### Project Health Report (NEW - v1.1.25)
Get a comprehensive assessment of your entire project's health in one command. Reads all existing LUNA analysis data (complexity heatmap, dead code, component map, dependency graph, QA report) and produces an AI-generated health report.

```
Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) → "LUNA: Project Health Report"
```

**Report includes:**
- **Executive Summary** - 3-4 sentence overview of project health
- **Health Score** - Overall 1-10 rating with justification
- **Critical Issues** - Things that will cause bugs or maintenance nightmares
- **Technical Debt** - Complexity hotspots, dead code, circular dependencies
- **Architecture Assessment** - How well-organized is the code?
- **Prioritized Recommendations** - Numbered list, most important first

**Key details:**
- Uses your configured LUNA model (default: gpt-4o, FREE)
- Reads all existing `.codebase/` analysis files -- no extra generation needed
- Auto-detects circular dependencies from the dependency graph
- Results open in an untitled tab -- close when done, nothing saved to disk
- Cancellable via the progress notification

### Suggest Refactorings (NEW - v1.1.25)
Get specific, actionable refactoring recommendations for high-complexity files. The AI reads the actual code and provides concrete steps to reduce complexity.

```
Command Palette → "LUNA: Suggest Refactorings"
- or -
Right-click any file → "LUNA: Suggest Refactorings"
```

**Three modes:**
1. **Right-click a file** - Get refactoring suggestions for that specific file
2. **Open a file + Command Palette** - Analyzes the current editor file
3. **Command Palette (no file open)** - Auto-selects the top 5 highest-complexity files (7+/10) from your heatmap and lets you pick which to analyze

**For each file, you get:**
- Current issues and code smells detected
- Prioritized refactoring recommendations (Extract Method, Split Class, etc.)
- Specific functions/lines to change
- Quick wins (< 5 min) vs structural changes (30+ min)
- Estimated complexity score after refactoring

**Key details:**
- Uses your configured LUNA model (default: gpt-4o, FREE)
- Reads the real source code + LUNA summary for full context
- Focuses on structural improvements, not superficial stuff like variable naming
- Results open in an untitled tab -- close when done

### Quality Assurance Reviews
After fast deterministic analysis, Copilot validates the results:

**Enabled by default** - Configure in Settings → `Enable Copilot QA`

**What gets reviewed:**
- Dead code detection (reduces false positives)
- Complexity scores (validates against actual patterns)
- Component categorization (checks groupings make sense)

**Results saved to:** `.codebase/QA_REPORT.json`

**Benefits:**
- Fewer false positive "dead code" warnings
- Framework-aware (ComfyUI, Django, FastAPI, etc.)
- More accurate refactoring recommendations

### Dead Code Analysis
Find unused exports with AI verification:
```
.codebase/dead-code-analysis.json
```

### Complexity Heatmap  
Refactoring candidates with AI-validated scores (0-10):
```
.codebase/complexity-heatmap.json
```
- 8-10: Needs refactoring
- 6-7: Monitor quality
- 0-5: Good

### Custom Templates (Power User)
Add domain-specific fields to summaries:
```json
{
  "template": {
    "securityConsiderations": "Note security issues",
    "vibeCheck": "3 emojis describing code energy"
  }
}
```
Copy to `.codebase/.luna-template.json` to enable.
